# PoE_watchmap
Scans PoE map data in the clipboard for noteworthy mods and displays it in an overlay

Requires Python 3.0, is a standalone python script
Based on https://gitlab.com/vtopan/path-of-exile-python-3-sample-tools by Vlad Topan

Overlay runs above all windows and displays latest map info. Terminal displays all previously copied map information.
Currently looks for reflect, no regen, no leech, and less-res maps.
